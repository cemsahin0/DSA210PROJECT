# DSA210PROJECT
Hello I am Halis Cem Şahin (31035) and, I am doing my project on my health data and weather data. 
### **Activity and Weather Relationship Analysis**

#### **Motivation:**
This project explores how weather conditions impact daily activity levels. By analyzing my step count data and weather patterns, I aimed to uncover trends and improve daily routines for better health outcomes.

#### **Data Source:**
1. **Step Count Data:** Extracted from the Apple Health app, providing daily steps for 2024.
2. **Weather Data:** Retrieved from Meteostat, including temperature, precipitation, and weather conditions, merged with step data using dates.

#### **Data Analysis:**
1. Cleaned and merged datasets for consistent analysis.
2. Conducted EDA to visualize step counts across different weather conditions.
3. Examined correlations between step counts and weather variables.
4. Analyzed seasonal trends to understand how behavior changes over time.

#### **Findings:**
- Higher activity levels on sunny days (~30% more steps than rainy days).
- Moderate temperatures (15°C to 25°C) correlated with the most steps.
- Winter months showed a noticeable decline in activity due to weather.

#### **Limitations and Future Work:**
- Single-year data may not reflect long-term trends.
- Adding variables like personal schedules or time of day could enhance insights.
- Future work includes multi-year data analysis and step count prediction models using weather forecasts. 

This project demonstrates how personal data can reveal meaningful insights to optimize daily habits and achieve health goals more effectively.
